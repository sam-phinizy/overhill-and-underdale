### Play test 1
Tried out the standard party against 3 skeletons and 2 zombies. If anything the initial characters are too powerful. Scaling up the fighter's vigor to D8 from D6 means that they really can't miss. I probably need to scale up the monsters some more, not sure if i want to scale # appearing or the defense.

Another idea will be to have the character stats be freely assigned except for the 'primary' stat. That way you can have a rogue with a D6 in Vigor or fighter with a D6 in Quick. This will allow for more varied characters and more interesting party dynamics.
