Here is the text cleaned up:

# Combat

Combat is resolved in the following way:

## Engagement
The party can choose to:

- Immediately attack
- Try to talk to the monsters
- Try to sneak past them

If they choose to attack, initiate combat. If they choose to talk, roll for the monsters' reaction. If they choose to sneak, handle it as a stealth check.

## Rounds
Each round is played as follows:

1. The characters resolve their actions first.
2. Then the monsters take their actions.

The basic combat mechanic works as follows:
- The character rolls the applicable die for their action.
- If the character's roll exceeds the monster's defense value, they hit the monster.
- For every multiple of the monster's defense value the character rolls, they hit the monster an additional time.

For example, using a D6 for a character and a monster with a defense of 3:
- If the character rolls a 2, they miss.
- If the character rolls a 4, they hit the monster once.
- If the character rolls a 6, they hit the monster twice.

Then the monsters attack. Each monster picks a character to attack, starting with the one that did the most damage to them last round. The character rolls the applicable die for their defense. If they roll over the monster's attack value, they dodge the attack.

## Stance
Each character can choose a stance at the beginning of the round:

- Aggressive Stance: +1 to attack, -1 to defense
- Defensive Stance: +1 to defense, -1 to attack
- Neutral Stance: No bonus or penalty
- Rearguard Stance: +1 to defense, -1 to attack. The Rearguard character can only be attacked if all other characters are incapacitated, or by ranged weapons/special abilities.

The party formation works as follows:
- For every character in the Rearguard, there must be two characters in the Front Guard.
- This may be modified by room size or special abilities. 

This stance and formation system allows the party to strategically position themselves for combat, balancing offense and defense as needed.

### Monster Positioning

- By default, all melee-focused monsters are in the Front Guard.
- Ranged-focused monsters are in the Rearguard.
- Monsters with equal melee and ranged capabilities are in the Front Guard.
