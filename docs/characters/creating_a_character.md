## Character Creation

Characters have four attributes:

- Vigor
- Wise
- Quick
- Smart

Each attribute is represented by a die. The die represents the character's ability to perform actions. The higher the die, the better the character is at that attribute. Each character starts with a D8, D6 and two D4s in attributes. Choose a class and assign the D8 to the primary attribute for that class. The other attributes can be assigned as you see fit. Each class does have a suggested attribute assignment but that is only a guideline.

Each character has a level that represents their experience. The level is used to determine the character's health and other abilities.


## Warrior

**Primary Attribute:** Vigor

_Suggested Attributes:_

| Vigor | Wise | Quick | Smart |
|-------|------|-------|-------|
| *D8*  | D4   | D6    | D4    |


_Health:_ Level + 10

### Abilities

- Can add their level to any melee attack.

### Feats:
Warriors have the ability to learn feats as they level up. These let them do additional acts of martial prowess. An example feat might be:

- Shield wall: If equipped with a shield you can act as though you're two characters in the front guard.
- Dual Wield: You can attack with two weapons at once. Roll your $quick against the monsters defense. For each success you can do one attack with your vigor against the monster, adding 1/2 your level. 
- Frenzy: You can attack twice in a round. Roll the following attack with disadvantage.
- Accept the blade: You can take a hit for another character. Roll your $quick against the monsters attack. If you succeed you take the damage instead of the other character.
- Shield Bash: You can use your shield to knock a monster back. Roll your $quick against the monsters defense. If you succeed the monster is knocked back and can't attack this round. If you fail the monster gets a free attack against you as well as it's original attack.

A character can learn a feat at every odd level. They do need to find a trainer to learn the feat.
