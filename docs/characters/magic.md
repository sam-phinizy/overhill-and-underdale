## Casting Magic

To cast a spell a player rolls the character's smarts die and compares the result to the spells level. If the smarts die is >= to the spell level then the spell suceedes. If it's lower then the spells level then the spell fails. If they roll a one then they roll on the spell mishaps table adding the spells level to the roll.

They can choose to push their spell. This means they add additional dice to roll. Each die is compared against the spells target level accruing a successes and failures. A character can choose to push the roll up to their level divided by two rounded down. The first die they add is equal to their smarts. The next one is the next step down and so forth down to a d2. 

## Spells

Magic Dart(Level 1): Do a Smarts ranged attack for each die that succeeds at the dies level against monsters.

## Learning Spells

A character with a week of study can attempt to learn a spell from a scroll that they find. To do so they roll smarts against the spell level. They need to succeed a number of times equal to the spells level - their level to a minimum of 1.

Hard Mode: If you roll a one then the scrolls crumbles into dust and you don't learn the spell.


# Divine Magic

Each time a player prays they roll their wise and add their level. If they roll over the prayers level they succeed. If they roll under the prayer's risk level they both fail and can't pray any more until they atone. (Atonement to start will be the end of the adventure.)

## Prayer List:
- Heal(Level 3, Risk 1): Upon success the player can roll 1d6 and heal a companion or themselves for that much damage. They can bump up the level and risk by one to heal an additional 1d6.

- Bless(Level 3, Risk 2): Upon success the character gives a player a blessing on one attribute. For the next check they gain advantage(can roll the die twice and take the highest).
