# Dungeons

Dungeons are the prototypical adventure location. They are dark, dangerous, and full of treasure. They are also the most common location for adventurers to find themselves in. Dungeons are typically underground, but can also be found in ruins, caves, and other locations.

Dungeons can either be randomly generated or pre-designed. Randomly generated dungeons are created using a set of tables and cards that are rolled on and drawn to create the dungeon. Pre-designed dungeons are either pre-drawn maps and legends or a set of cards that are drawn to create the dungeon with a specific theme.


## Random Dungeon Generation

Random dungeons are created using using cards to determine the layout of the dungeons and random tables to determine the contents of the rooms both in terms of monsters as well as any traps etc. 

### Starting a dungeon

To start the dungeon flip over the first dungeon card from the 'entrance' deck. This will be the entrance to the dungeon. Move your indicator to that tile and choose which exit you take. Do that, and flip over the next card. This will be the next room. You can choose the orientation of the room and place it next to the entrance. Then roll on the table to determine what is in the room.
