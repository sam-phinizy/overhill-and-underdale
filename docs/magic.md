# Arcane Magic
Spells:
All spells have a level, to cast a spell a character rolls their 'Smart' die against the spells target. If they exceed the level then they succeed. If they roll a one then a spell mishap happens. Roll on the spell mishaps table. A magic user can choose to push their spell. This means they can roll extra dice up to their level divided by two rounded down. They can then roll the die the next step down from their smarts. So a 2nd level magic user with D8 smarts could choose to push the spell and roll a D8 and a D6, both raising the chance of success but also raising the risk of rolling on the spell mishaps.

Spells
Magic Dart(Level 2): Do a smarts attack for each die that succeeds at the dies level against monsters. 


# Divine Magic

Each time a player prays they roll their wise and add their level. If they roll over the prayers level they succeed. If they roll under the prayer's risk level they both fail and can't pray any more until they atone. (Atonement to start will be the end of the adventure.)

Prayer List:
- Heal(Level 3, Risk 1): Upon success the player can roll 1d6 and heal a companion or themselves for that much damage. 
- Bless(Level 3, Risk 2): Upon success the character gives a player a blessing on one attribute. For the next check they gain advantage(can roll the die twice and take the highest).
