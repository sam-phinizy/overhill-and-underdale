# Overhill and Underdale

## Overview

Overhil and Underdale is a simple roleplaying game designed primarily for solo-roleplaying. It is a simple system that uses the typical polyhedral dice set (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) to resolves actions. The goal is to have a system that is fun, and easy to use.

## Character Creation

Characters have four attributes:

- Vigor
- Wise
- Quick
- Smart

Each attribute is represented by a die. The die represents the character's ability to perform actions. The higher the die, the better the character is at that attribute. 

Each character has a class that determines their starting attributes and abilities. 

Each character has a level that represents their experience. The level is used to determine the character's health and other abilities.
