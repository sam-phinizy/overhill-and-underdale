Each character rolls that die plus any level or other modifiers each time they want to do something like attack a group of monsters etc. 

Monsters
Currently use the FAD monster tables. Each set of monsters has abilities similar to the players that are static numbers. When the players attack the monsters they need to roll this number or higher to damage the monster or if the monster attacks the player they roll this number or higher to avoid the damage.

For instance a Gobbo would be this:

**Gobbo Smacker:**
Num appearing: 1d6
Melee attack: 1, Range: 0, Defense: 1


A player attacks a gobbo using melee, they roll their vigor which is a D6. They roll a 4 which is over the goblins defense. This causes them to kill two goblins, 4-2 = 2 and then 2-2=0.
